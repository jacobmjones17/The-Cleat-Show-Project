# Cleat-Show

### Welcome to Cleat-Show!
I have created an app that allows users to search their favorite soccer cleats. Users can look through the cleats and figure out which ones they like the best! They can use the search bar in order to filter out the type of cleats they are looking for. They also have a category tab that they can specifically go and see each category of cleat. Finally, there is a tab that takes them to Soccer.com so they can purchase the cleats they are wanting.
