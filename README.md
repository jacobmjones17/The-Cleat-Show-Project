# Cleat-Show

### Welcome to Cleat-Show!
I have created an app that allows users to search their favorite soccer cleats. Users can scroll through the first ten results provided by the API and in greater detail they can examine each cleat and a short synopsis of its content. Users are also able to leave likes and reviews for their favorite cleats!
